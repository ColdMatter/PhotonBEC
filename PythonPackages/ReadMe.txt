This folder will contain utilities for the Photon BEC experiment. Version control is rather tricky. Old scripts will not always run again if the packages have changed. I don't know how to solve this problem robustly.

To solve this robustly, we will use git for version control
When you wish to run old scripts, simply pull the old versions of the packages
