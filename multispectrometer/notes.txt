the dll C:\Program Files (x86)\AvaSoft8\AS5216.dll supposedly contains functions to get data
 product version 2.2.0.0

the manual is in D:\Docs\Manuals\Avantes_spectrometer

here is the driver directory?
 C:\AS5216-DLL_2.2\
contains example source files


i installed mingw to get gdb and make
 that requires putting the mingw/bin in the path
 -actually dont use make, it may be really nice but it can be annoying to people who dont know it
  so use many batch files instead
after some searching im quite sure that you cant link to c++ DLLs across compilers, msvs and mingw

so i have to use msvs..
yes i can make the example project compile, however its a huge GUI app when we just need a small command line one
ok so that works, you just copy over the .h, .lib and .dll files and tell msvs to use them

as an aside, Rob's python dll loading attempt might actually be made to work, i only realise that after doing it in c++ to learn the whole API, i think Rob used ASV_Activate() wrong or something
 naturally it will always be hard to learn the api, learning the internal details of the api and at the same time as learning python ctypes for me
 
 the api has blocking and non-blocking kinds of data tranfer, for our application blocking functions make the most sense
 
actually it seems like you can use the same settings as in the GUI AvaSoft program, use AVS_GetParameter

use AVS_UseHighResAdc to get the full 16 bit measurement

its possible to convert scope data (ADC counts) to power distribution, ctrl+f it in the manual

btw for dlls in MSVS use dumpbin \exports <nameofdll> to see the names 
 in the developer command promopt for VS2012

 to open the microsoft visual studios project, make sure to open it using the .sln, the so-called solution file
